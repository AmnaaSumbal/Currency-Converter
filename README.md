# Currency-Converter

This project is a Currency Converter GUI Application which converts the USD, PKR, INR or QR currencies.

Overall, creating a currency converter GUI application in Python involves choosing an API, installing required libraries, fetching data from the API, creating a graphical user interface, writing code for currency conversion, and displaying the results. With the right tools and knowledge, this task can be accomplished in a relatively short amount of time. 

The application has an intuitive interface that allows users to enter currency values and select the currencies they want to convert using dropdown menus or similar user inputs. The currency converter fetches real-time exchange rates from an API, which allows it to provide accurate and up-to-date conversion results. Furthermore, the application also has a button or function to reset or clear all input fields and allow users to start a new conversion.

Many more functions can also be added to enhance its usability and functionality.
